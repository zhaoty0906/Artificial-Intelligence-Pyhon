Parse rules have five elements - Name, Pattern, Type, Action, and Value for those actions

A name is a string with no spaces.
A patterns is a list of words or references to other patterns OR a disjunct of words or  
    references to other patterns
A Type is a Sentence or a Phrase
The action is the action that the rule invokes
The Value is the thing that the action is done on 

A rule can be defined with just a name and a pattern
